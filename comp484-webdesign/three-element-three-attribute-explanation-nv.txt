Nam Vu explantions

The three elements i chosen are:
<code>
<hr>
<output>

The three attributes ive chosed are:
src
onclick
type


<code> is used to show those who are curious what code is used for the javascript on the screen i used.
<hr> was used to split the results from the other part of the container
<output> was used to specify the results in a output of the answer so there's flexibility on to change the element


"src" is an attribute used in <script> element to determine the javascript file that the website is going to use

"onclick" is an attribute tied to the <button> element and is used to perform an action.

"type" determines the variable that is entered in the <input> element. The type I've chosen are numbers which would only accept numbers as valid inputs for the javascript code.
